## Intro: 


## SMILES
- Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification

### SMILES Specification Rules

#### Atoms
1. Atoms are represented by atomic symbols
2. Metal stoms are represented with symbols in square brackets
3. Brackets can be omitted for B, C, N, O, P, S and Halides

#### Bonds
1. Single, double, triple bonds are represented by the symbols -, =, and # repspectively
2. Adjacent atoms are assumed to be connected to each other by a single or aromatic bond

#### Cyclic structures

- Aromatic C, O, S and N atoms are shown lower case 'c', 'o', 's', 'n'
- Apliphatic C, O, S and N atoms are shown in upper case 'C', 'O', 'S', and 'N'

#### Branches
- specified by enclosing them in parenthesis, and can be nested or arranged

#### Stereo-chemistry
- configuration around double bonds
