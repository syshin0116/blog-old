## What is Zettelkasten?
- means "books of cards" in German
- a method to deal with knowledge in your life

	A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.
	
	제텔카스텐은 사고와 글쓰기를 위한 개인용 도구입니다. 하이퍼텍스트 기능이 있어 생각의 웹을 만들 수 있습니다. 다른 시스템과의 차이점은 임의의 크기와 형식의 노트 대신 생각의 웹을 만들고, 컬렉션이 아닌 연결을 강조한다는 점입니다.


## Luhmann’s Zettelkasten: The beginning

Niklas Luhmann: 
- considered godfather of Zettelkasten Method
- highly productive social scientist

What was his Zettelkasten like?
- a collection of notes on papaer slips with a special twist: surfable *hypertext* that helped him navigate the drawer cabinet containing all the paper slips
	> #### Surfable? 
	> Think of Wikipedia: there are links to other articles → you surf on articles

Luhmann used Zettelkasten to: 
1. Build a web of knowledge
2. Retrieve the right memory
3. Find connections among topics
4. Develop ideas and arguments

### Method


![](https://i.imgur.com/z9PAqU1.png)

Luhmann had two boxes:
1. Reference Box
	- contains reference detail
	- brief notes about content
2. Main Box
	- Ideas, thories, arguments, dicussions

#### Steps

1. Take Literature Notes
	- information you don't want to forget
	- things you might use later
2. Take Reference Notes
	- reference details + brief note about the content
3. Make Permanet Notes
	- go though notes taken and make new notes
	- goal is not to collect as many notes but to add values to existing ideas, arguments, and discussions
> find meaning of what you just learned, connect it to what you already knew

4. Review and Repeat

#### Finding meaningful connections
- How does this idea fit into what I already knew?
- Can this be explained by something else?
- What does X mean for Y?
- How can I usse this idea to explain Z?


#### Finding Keywords

Finding keyword is
- not about where to store information
- but about how to **retrieve** it

It is not about:
- findind most fitting word
- what category does this fall into

Instead, it is about:
- in which circumstances do I want to stuble upon this note?
- when and how will I use this idea?

"Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topic you're working on or interested in, never by looking at the notes in isolation"
